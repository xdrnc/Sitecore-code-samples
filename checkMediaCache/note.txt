how to use:
1. put both of these aspx and aspx.cs into your sitecore website folder
2. run <yoursite>/checkmedia.aspx
3. copy the "item path" from content editor as the input to the textbox
4. click the button "check media cache folder"

this helps to find in which folder the media cache would be created ;)

This is tested in XP 9.2.0
